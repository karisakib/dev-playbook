## Developer API's and SDK's:

---

- Provide developers a client side SDK for your API. These code packages are designed to help developers get up and running quickly with their projects by simplifying some of the transactional layers and setup of an application.

- Ido Green, developer advocate at Google, on what makes an API good: “The API should enable developers to do one thing really well. It’s not as easy as it sounds, and you want to be clear on what the API is not going to do as well.”

- Make your developer APIs fast and easy to get started using.

- No matter how carefully we design and build our core API, developers continue to create products we’d never expect. We give them the freedom to build what they like. Designing an API is much like designing a transportation network. Rather than prescribing an end state or destination, a good API expands the very notion of what’s possible for developers. Romain Huet, head of developer relations at Stripe

- In some cases, you can supplement the ease of use by providing interactive documentation online, where developers have a sandbox to test out your API. Oftentimes, developers can use these interfaces to test code and preview results without having to implement authentication. A great example of sandbox-based documentation is Stripe’s documentation.

- APIs need to be consistent. That could include anything from data access patterns to error handling to naming. The reason consistency is important is that it reduces the cognitive load on developers who are trying to figure out your API. With less consistency, different developers will need to reimplement the same logic over and over again.

- Another best practice for designing APIs is making troubleshooting easy for developers. This can be done through returning meaningful errors as well as by building tooling. Providing these errors with details leads to a better developer experience. Error codes that are machine-readable strings allow developers to programmatically handle errors in their code bases.

When deprecating an API or an endpoint, add release notes to indicate deprecation.

Documentations should always provide sample code.

The API and the documentation both should be easy to understand.

The API should have a good SDK in multiple languages.

## The API should be easy to test.

Building a successful API is an art, comprising business analysis, technology architecture, software development, partnership, content writing, developer relations, support, and marketing.

Validate your API with real users; ask your developers for constant feedback; be transparent with your changes, policies, rate limits, and updates; and be a member of your own developer community.

After you unlock the product-market fit for your API and foster a developer ecosystem around it, you will experience magic—developers will use your API to innovate, empower amazing new solutions, and build things you didn’t think were possible.

There is no better feeling than building something that millions of people use every day to make their lives better. Trust us, we have done that, and you can, too.
