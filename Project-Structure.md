## Project Structure

### To ensure scalability as your application grows

Subdivide Large Resources: As a resource like users expands, break it down into smaller submodules or domains, such as profile, settings, and subscription. Each subdomain should have its own folders for models, controllers, and routes, making the resource more manageable and organized.

## `views`

```plaintext
views/
├── auth/
│   ├── Login.tsx
│   ├── Signup.tsx
│   ├── ForgotPassword.tsx
│   ├── AuthLayout.tsx       # Optional layout for auth pages
│   ├── authRoutes.tsx       # Routes for authentication
```

Consider Domain-Driven Design (DDD): As complexity increases, shift your organization from resource-based to domain-based. For example, instead of having all user-related logic in one place, you could organize your code around business domains, grouping models, controllers, and routes according to their specific domain logic, like UserProfile, UserSettings, and UserSubscription. This approach helps maintain clarity and modularity in a large application.

### Difference between /utils and /lib

The difference between a /utils and a /lib folder generally comes down to the type of functionality and the scope of the code they contain. While there’s some overlap and the exact distinction can vary depending on the project or team, here’s a general breakdown:

##### /utils Folder:

Purpose: The /utils (short for "utilities") folder typically contains small, reusable helper functions or utility modules. These functions are usually stateless and perform generic tasks like data formatting, string manipulation, date calculations, logging, etc.

Scope: Utilities are often project-specific and are designed to be used within the context of a single project. They are usually lightweight and focused on specific tasks that don’t necessarily belong to any single module or component.

Examples:

- Functions for formatting dates or numbers.
- String manipulation utilities.
- Basic validation functions.
- Commonly used constants or configurations.

```javascript
function formatDate(date) {
 return new Intl.DateTimeFormat("en-US").format(date);
}

function generateRandomString(length) {
 return Math.random()
  .toString(36)
  .substring(2, length + 2);
}
```

##### /lib Folder:

Purpose: The /lib (short for "library") folder typically contains larger, more complex modules or libraries. These might be collections of functions, classes, or third-party integrations that provide more substantial functionality. The code in /lib might be reusable across multiple projects or represent a self-contained library within your application.

Scope: Code in /lib is often more general-purpose and could potentially be extracted into its own package or module for reuse across different projects. These libraries might include custom implementations of significant functionality like API clients, database wrappers, or even more substantial utilities that don’t fit the narrow, helper-focused nature of /utils.

##### Summary of Differences:

- Size and Complexity:
  - /utils functions are generally small, simple, and focused on specific tasks.
  - /lib modules are often larger and more complex, potentially encompassing a broader range of functionality.
- Scope:
  - /utils is typically project-specific, providing small utilities that don’t warrant their own library.
  - /lib might contain more substantial code that could be reused across different projects or packaged as a standalone module.
- Use Case:
  - Use /utils for small, helper functions that are specific to the project.
  - Use /lib for more complex, potentially reusable libraries or modules that encapsulate significant functionality.

### 7. The /config directory

You might also have a default.js file with default settings that apply across all environments, which can be overridden by environment-specific files.

You may also have a .env file for storing environment variables. These are typically loaded using a package like dotenv.

Configuration settings for connecting to databases, including connection strings, credentials, and other related options.
